  <h2>Design folder</h2>
 </header>
 <div>
  <p>The design folder is a compulsory component of MYP technology!</p>
  <p>As students progress through the different stages of the design cycle, they are constantly experimenting with ideas, researching topics, compiling sources, brainstorming issues, sketching possible solutions, making changes, rejecting proposals and critically evaluating their work. All relevant activities and outcomes should be recorded, and dated, in the design folder.</p>
  <p>The design folder is a compilation of evidence that accompanies the final product/solution for a unit of work.</p>
  <p>Students formally record the results of their research, their various plans and designs and the evaluation of their finished products/solutions in the design folder.</p>
  <p>The design folder must be clearly divided into: investigate, design, plan, create, evaluate. It must begin with the student’s investigation and end with the evaluation.</p>

   <h3>Problem: Briefly explain in your own words what your task is.</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>The task is to learn and master HMLT5and CSS and apply my knowledge to the project at hand, which is to create a website showing how well I have understood HTML5 and CSS and to what extend I can use both of them.<p>
  </div>

   <h3>How is this task relevant to real issues? (Life, society and the environment)</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>Computers are used by most people all around the world and working with them will always be a part of our daily life no matter what profession we choose to follow. In this case, knowing HTML will help us solve numerous problems that might occur with our computers, for example, when something goes wrong with a site that might or might not be yours – you will know how to fix it! Also, making and designing our own web-pages is a great experience that might always be useful in the future even if I do not choose to go into a career that requires me to do any kind of web-designing. And, it’s even more important if you want to design web-pages because HTML as a language can give us broad abilities to create and tweak our sites.<p>

   <h3>How is the task related to the Area of Interaction?</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>The area of interaction of our current unit is learning HTML, this task will help us summarize how much we have learned and how well we can use our knowledge. We will also be learning about how to learn HTML and CSS.<p>

   <h3>What I need to investigate to complete the task:</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>Information about HTML! Elements of HTML. HTML and CSS online tutorials and references. How HTML5 documents are produced. Other modern webpages that use HTML.<p>

   <h3>Information collected:</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>Here is <a href="hw1.html">Homework 1</a>, which shows how to use basic HTML elements like headings and links.</p>
  <p>Here is <a href="hw2.html">Homework 2</a>, which shows more complex HTML elements, like lists, tables, and embedded images.</p>
  <p>Here is <a href="hw34.html">Homework 3 and 4</a>,which discuss the semantic elements and how to use them</p>

<h3><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#new-elements">Diveintohtml</a></h3>

<p>1. Did the source have a lot of information, or a little?</p>
<p>This source had a huge amount of information and I would say that it was one of the best sources to work with. It gave more information about specific things than other sources did.</p>
<p>2. Was the source easy to understand, or difficult?</p>
<p>It was quite easy to understand but I did need to re-read some things and compare them to other sources to make sure that I got everything right.</p>
<p>3. Did the source help you to understand the elements you read about?</p>
<p>It did help me understand the elements.</p>
<p>4. Does the source seem professional and reliable? Why or why not?</p>
<p>It seems quite professional and I liked the design of this source, it was different and made the source aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>
<p>I would use this source but honestly, if I would have to rely only on this source, I wouldn’t use it. It wouldn’t really help me during the practical work.</p>

<h3><a href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/">Html5doctor</a></h3>

<p>1. Did the source have a lot of information, or a little?</p>
<p>A lot of information but not necessarily about the things I needed at the moment or at this stage.</p>
<p>2. Was the source easy to understand, or difficult?</p>
<p>The information was written in a completely understandable way.</p>
<p>3. Did the source help you to understand the elements you read about?</p>
<p>No, It hardly helped me understand anything but I did get more information about Html5 and semantics themselves.</p>
<p>4. Does the source seem professional and reliable? Why or why not?</p>
<p>It seems like it wasn’t written by a boring 80 year old professor or a computer and was quite fun to read, so, it definitely felt reliable to me, not quite professional though.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>
<p>To be honest, I wouldn’t. It was good to read once and understand the importance of semantic elements.</p>

<p>3. Did the source help you to understand the elements you read about?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>4. Does the source seem professional and reliable? Why or why not?</p>
<p>It does seem professional and reliable and it’s quite obvious that it took some effort and was probably made by someone who knows html 5 well and wanted to share their knowledge with us.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>
<p>I will be using this source since it will help me understand what elements to use when.</p>

<p>3. Did the source help you to understand the elements you read about?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>4. Does the source seem professional and reliable? Why or why not?</p>
<p>It seems professional and reliable because the information given was short and straightforward.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>

<p>3. Did the source help you to understand the elements you read about?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>4. Does the source seem professional and reliable? Why or why not?</p>
<p>It does since a lot of those semantic tags were used on the page itself, including the navigation element which was not used on a lot of those sources.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Yes, just like the previous source I found that this one was perfect for me.</p>

<p>It looked kind of amateur compared to other resources but I guess it was reliable since the text was quite similar to the text I read in other sources.</p>
<p>5. Would you use this source while creating an HTML product? Why or why not?</p>
<p>I would use it since I’m not really dissatisfied with it but other sources were better than this one in some ways.</p>

  <p>Now that I’ve finished styling my page, I have an incomplete .html file, and a .css file that styles the html completely.I will need to complete the design so it will contain all of the criterions of the design folder. I will also add a navigation menu to the file so it will be easier for the user to get to certain criterions.  I will also add a button that will return the user to the top of the page wherever on the page they might be. The button will be styled with css with the help of <a href=" http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-implement-a-sticky-back-to-top-button/">this tutorial.</a>  
  After I complete the .html file, I will fill in the answers to the questions in our design folder.  By the time I get to Criterion D, I will have answered all of the questions in Criteria A, B, and C. Once my .html design folder is done and completely filled in,  I will check the final product to see if there are any changes that I would like to make to the .css file.  I might also need to add styling to the Nav that I’ve added, and to the time-table I wrote for Criterion C.  When all of those things are done and over with, my product is officially finished.At each step I will have to make sure that my product works – that the .css files and .html files are properly linked, that the file names and locations are correct, and that any other links or embedded images I’ve put in the file are functioning.</p>

  <div class="answer">
  <p>In my opinion, each step in this plan is quite detailed and understandable. All steps are logical as they will help me finish the product and know exactly what I am going to be doing after what to complete this design.  The plan includes the exact amount of time I will need and maybe even more, but everything depends on how fast or slow I will be able to complete certain steps. The steps are in a completely logical order. All resources needed to complete the steps are included and hopefully, I will be able to follow the plan.

  <h4>Investigate</h4>
  <p>I did really well on this stage, completed all works due the deadline and in my opinion could not have done better on this task. Except, I could have memorized all the codes I read tutorials about then.</p>
  <h4>Plan</h4>
  <p>This stage went quite smoothly and I did not have any complications. If I could re-do this stage I would change the times in the plan a little bit and maybe experiment more with designs. Overall, I did okay at this stage even though my designs lacked creativity in some ways and could have been improved.</p>
  <h4>Create</h4>
  <p>This stage took the most time out of all things and was the hardest to complete. There was a lot to code and even though I did not make many mistakes while coding, there were the 5 mistakes that I could not fix myself no matter how hard I tried. </p>
  <h4>Evaluate</h4>
