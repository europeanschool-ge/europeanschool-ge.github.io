<p>Design 1: with explanations - Compare your design with the design specification</p>
<div>I will make the design called old Rome which is simpler to make than the first one. The design will have no borders and it will be much hard to understand.</div>
<p>Design 2: with explanations - Compare your design with the design specification<p/>
<div>I will make colorful design with colorful text and cool design but it will be not easy for me to do that. I  will make links to my homework’s and show my work in the design. I will make the boxes and links on them.</div>
<p>Which design will you choose to create and why. List the tools you will use.</p>
<div>I chose design 2 because it is more equal to my knowledge of HTML that the first one. I think it is not better design.
 I used notepad to write on.</div>


<section id="criteria c">
<h2>criteria C</h2>
<p>Explain in detail the step by step process of using the Resource</p>4
<div>I opened the notepad and I started to make the sections of the criteria’s. After I made them I started to make the design of the project.
 After I started to write about the criteria’s. With this all information than I picked up links and put it in.</div>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>steps</th>
<th>Time Allocated</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Criteria A- working on the idea of the project</td>
<td>1 week</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Criteria B- design</td>
<td>1 week</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Criteria C- planning</td>
<td>1 week</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Evaluate your plan – Go through your plan and explain if you need to make any modifications and why.</p>
<div>I think I needed more time to make my design and more time to complete my criteria’s because working together in html and with design folder I think it is hard needed more time for my design because I can’t work really fast. I made my own template and made myself more confused.</div>
<section id="criteria D">

Unlike others I made my own design and put everything in my own words. I made my output with &lt;p> and &lt;div> and of coerce &lt;/p> and &lt;/div> I made everything on notepad and type everything. I used a small time for my design like 10 minutes but for filling it 30 minutes.</div>

<div>I did not follow my plan because I had better ideas. I used more time for things that I had to do in 1 week…</div>
