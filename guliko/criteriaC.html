  <p>After finishing our design, we will have completed .html and .css files. we will have to complete our .html file so that it includes each element of design folder. we will also add <nav> to make it easier to navigate to criterias A, B, C, D and/or E.  If we want each criterion to have its own page, we will create separate .html files for each criterion.  Otherwise, we will have one long document with all of the criteria in one page.
After we complete our .html, we must fill in the design folder.  By the time we work on Criterion D, we will have answers for all of the questions in Criteria A, B, and C.  
when our .html design folder is totally completed and filled in, we should check our product to see if there are any changes that we want to make to our .css file.  
At each step we must make sure that our product works – that the .css files and .html files are properly linked, that our file names and locations are correct, and that any other links we put in are working correctly.</p>

  <div class="answer">
  <p>I made a plan for creation of my final product, i wrote only important things there as too many details would make it too big and confusing. The steps in my plan are logical and easy to follow. The plan tells us approximately how much time we will spend on creation of the product but turned out that i needed much more time than it was told. I followed my plan but the details should ahve been shown, it would just make it easier.</p>
