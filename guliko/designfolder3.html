  <h2>Design folder</h2>
 </header>
 <div>
  <p>The design folder is a compulsory component of MYP technology!</p>
  <p>As students progress through the different stages of the design cycle, they are constantly experimenting with ideas, researching topics, compiling sources, brainstorming issues, sketching possible solutions, making changes, rejecting proposals and critically evaluating their work. All relevant activities and outcomes should be recorded, and dated, in the design folder.</p>
  <p>The design folder is a compilation of evidence that accompanies the final product/solution for a unit of work.</p>
  <p>Students formally record the results of their research, their various plans and designs and the evaluation of their finished products/solutions in the design folder.</p>
  <p>The design folder must be clearly divided into: investigate, design, plan, create, evaluate. It must begin with the student’s investigation and end with the evaluation.</p>
