  <div class="answer">
  <p>I will create designs by editing a CSS file to style an HTML document.  The document will contain the design folder. I’ll make three or four different designs and then choose the best one for my final product.</p>

  <div class="answer">
  <p><a href="designfolder1.html">Design 1</a> I like this design very much as it shows a huge knowledge of CSS, but the colors itself and text locations aren't very good, so I decided not to use this design.</p>

   <h3>Which design will you choose for your final product? Why? </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="answer">
  <p>I chose the design you’re looking at right now because it is the nicest one. It grabs person’s attention and makes it look interesting. I asked my classmates to help me choose the design and this one was the one the liked so I decided to use it as my final product. I asked them these questions:

<li> 1.	Is it beautiful? (Yeah, I like the colors very much)</li> 
<li> 2.	Is it readable?  (Yes as everything is not mixed up and the titles and paragraphs are shown well)</li> 
<li> 3.	Is it informative?  (Kind of. It tells me much info about HTML and CSS and if someone who has no idea about HTML/CSS it will be easy for him/her to understand it as there are many examples and useful links in this design folder)</li> 
<li> 4.	Is it usable, easy to use, and intuitive? (Yeah it’s usable and easy to use as well as it has all the instructions so it’s easy for me to understand things from it and how to use it.)</li> 
<li> 5.	Do you like the design? (Yes. I like the colors very much, they are not boring and makes me feel great when I look at it and the best thing about it is that it’s organized well as all criteria are not in one “document”. But I think it would be better if there were boxes around your answers because it would show your knowledge)</li>
