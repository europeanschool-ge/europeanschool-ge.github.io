       <p>Homer: Homer Jay Simpson was born in Springfield[17] as the third child of Abraham Simpson, and the only child of Mona Simpson. In 1960, Homer experimented to see if he could push fifteen crayons into his nose, which resulted in one being lodged into his brain and being responsible for his current low-average intelligence.</p>

       <p>Marge: Marge Bouvier once stated she has the same birthday as Randy Quaid (October 1)[5] and in other episode she claimed sharing her birthday with Meg Ryan (November 19), which is contradictory. In another episode, she stated that her birthstone would be emerald if she had been born three months later, indicating that she was born in February. In yet another episode, she claimed May was her birth month. We have also seen Marge's birthday appear on a calendar stating her birthday was on March 19. We have not seen a clear birth year. She is the youngest daughter of the Bouvier family. Marge was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier. She has a pair of big sisters, the joyless twins, Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer.</p>

       <p>Bart: Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever who is constantly in detention. He is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he was born: Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while he performed a sonogram on Marge, and moments after being born he set fire to Homer's tie (Marge saying that he could not have done it because he was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba".</p>

       <p>Lisa: Lisa Marie Simpson is a charismatic eight-year-old girl (born May 8th), who exceeds the standard achievement of intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. Lisa Simpson is a smart, witty, independent girl who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight she is already a member of MENSA with an IQ of 159.</p>
